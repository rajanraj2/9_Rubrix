    "ideal_solution": "Climate change is a pressing global challenge characterized by rising temperatures, extreme weather patterns, and environmental degradation. The proposed solution takes a holistic approach to mitigate climate change through policy interventions, technological advancements, sustainable practices, and public engagement.\n\n1. **Renewable Energy Transition**\n   - **Solar & Wind Expansion**: Increased investment in solar farms and wind energy projects.\n   - **Smart Grid Integration**: AI-powered energy distribution to optimize efficiency.\n\n2. **Carbon Footprint Reduction**\n   - **Sustainable Transportation**: Promoting electric vehicles (EVs), better public transit infrastructure.\n   - **Green Urban Planning**: Vertical forests, urban green spaces, and rooftop gardens.\n\n3. **Sustainable Agriculture & Land Use**\n   - **Regenerative Farming**: No-till farming, crop rotation, and organic methods to restore soil health.\n   - **Afforestation & Reforestation**: Large-scale tree planting initiatives to act as carbon sinks.\n\n4. **Circular Economy & Waste Management**\n   - **Zero-Waste Policies**: Incentives for recycling, biodegradable packaging mandates.\n   - **Upcycling & Eco-friendly Manufacturing**: Reduced industrial emissions through green alternatives.\n\n5. **Climate Resilience & Adaptation**\n   - **Infrastructure for Extreme Weather**: Flood-resistant housing, early warning systems.\n   - **Water Conservation**: Rainwater harvesting, desalination projects, smart irrigation systems.\n\n6. **Public Awareness & Global Cooperation**\n   - **Climate Education Programs**: School curriculum updates, awareness campaigns.\n   - **International Agreements**: Strengthening commitments to the Paris Agreement and climate financing.\n\nThis comprehensive solution integrates policy, technology, and community action to combat climate change and create a more sustainable future.",
    "student_submission": "The proposed solution addresses pedestrian safety on national highways by improving FOB usability and accessibility. Key components include:\n\n1. **Inclusive FOB Design**: Ramps, stairs, and elevators for all users, including elderly and disabled individuals. Distinct color-coded lanes to guide different user types.\n2. **Visual Engagement**: Bright-colored FOBs for better visibility, monthly graffiti, and posters to maintain public interest. Photo/video displays highlighting jaywalking dangers and interactive elements like floor puzzles.\n3. **Strategic FOB Placement**: Data-driven decisions for optimal FOB locations within 500-700 meters based on pedestrian movement analysis.\n4. **Technological Enhancements**: AI/ML-based smart surveillance for jaywalking detection and fine enforcement. Motion-sensor lighting for night-time safety.\n5. **Sustainability & Maintenance**: CSR funding and government grants for financial feasibility. Dedicated maintenance teams for periodic inspections.\n\nThe solution aims for short-term improvements in pedestrian awareness and long-term cultural shifts towards safer road-crossing habits through engaging, inclusive, and tech-driven interventions."
