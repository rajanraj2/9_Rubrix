    "ideal_solution": "Pedestrian safety on India's National Highways is a critical issue due to the underutilization of Foot Over Bridges (FOBs) and unsafe road crossings. The proposed solution offers a high-standard, comprehensive approach integrating behavioral strategies, environmental design, infrastructure enhancements, and technology to improve FOB utilization and effectiveness.\n\n1. **Enhancing FOB Utilization**\n   - **Behavioral Interventions**: Gamification (reward system), nudge theory (visual cues), awareness campaigns.\n   - **Regulation & Enforcement**: Fines for jaywalking, AI-powered surveillance for detection.\n\n2. **Structural & Accessibility Improvements**\n   - **Inclusive Design**: Ramps, escalators, proper lighting, weather-proofing.\n   - **Optimal Placement**: Data-driven site selection to ensure accessibility within 500-700 meters.\n\n3. **Surrounding Infrastructure & Engagement**\n   - **Urban Design Enhancements**: Green spaces, bicycle lanes, FOB-integrated kiosks.\n   - **Safety Features**: Speed bumps, pedestrian waiting zones, emergency call buttons.\n\n4. **Dedicated Pedestrian FOBs**\n   - **Design Innovations**: Transparent railings, anti-slip flooring, weather protection.\n   - **Efficient Access**: Smart elevators, tactile pathways for visually impaired users.\n\n5. **Mixed-Mode FOBs**\n   - **Lanes for Different Users**: Separate sections for pedestrians, cyclists, and two-wheelers.\n   - **Traffic Monitoring**: AI-powered congestion tracking, adaptive signage, automated gates.\n\n6. **Technology Integration**\n   - **AI & IoT for Data-Driven Decisions**: Smart footfall analytics, facial recognition for safety alerts.\n   - **Incentives & Citizen Engagement**: Mobile app with real-time traffic data and reward systems.\n\nThis holistic approach aims to increase FOB usage, enhance safety, improve accessibility, and foster community engagement, setting a benchmark for pedestrian safety solutions in India.",
    "student_submission": "The proposed solution addresses pedestrian safety on national highways by improving FOB usability and accessibility. Key components include:\n\n1. **Inclusive FOB Design**: Ramps, stairs, and elevators for all users, including elderly and disabled individuals. Distinct color-coded lanes to guide different user types.\n2. **Visual Engagement**: Bright-colored FOBs for better visibility, monthly graffiti, and posters to maintain public interest. Photo/video displays highlighting jaywalking dangers and interactive elements like floor puzzles.\n3. **Strategic FOB Placement**: Data-driven decisions for optimal FOB locations within 500-700 meters based on pedestrian movement analysis.\n4. **Technological Enhancements**: AI/ML-based smart surveillance for jaywalking detection and fine enforcement. Motion-sensor lighting for night-time safety.\n5. **Sustainability & Maintenance**: CSR funding and government grants for financial feasibility. Dedicated maintenance teams for periodic inspections.\n\nThe solution aims for short-term improvements in pedestrian awareness and long-term cultural shifts towards safer road-crossing habits through engaging, inclusive, and tech-driven interventions."
