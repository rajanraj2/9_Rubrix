    "problem_statement": "Climate change has become one of the most pressing global challenges of our time. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and environmental degradation are significantly impacting ecosystems, human health, and economies worldwide. One of the major contributors to climate change is carbon emissions from industrial activities, transportation, and deforestation. Despite international efforts, reducing carbon footprints remains a challenge due to a lack of sustainable alternatives, economic constraints, and limited public awareness. To address this, governments, organizations, and researchers are actively seeking innovative solutions that promote renewable energy adoption, sustainable urban planning, and green technologies. The goal is to transition towards a low-carbon economy while maintaining economic growth and social well-being.",
