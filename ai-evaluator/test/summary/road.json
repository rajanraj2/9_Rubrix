    "problem_statement": "All that you need to know about Road Safety Hackathon Did you know that on India's National Highways, pedestrian accidents are increasing at an alarming rate? In just one year, pedestrian fatalities have risen from 9,462 to 10,160, which means an average of one pedestrian dies every hour. Despite the presence of Foot Over Bridges (FOBs), many pedestrians continue to cross the roads at grade level, highlighting a critical safety issue. This highlights the urgency of addressing pedestrian and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) safety, especially the underutilization of Foot Over Bridges (FOBs) and the need for safer crossings and infrastructure improvements. In light of these concerning statistics, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Highway Operators Association - India (HOAI) are coming together to host a joint hackathon aimed at finding innovative solutions to improve pedestrian safety on national highways. This is an exciting opportunity for you to be part of a project that could make a real impact on road safety and help save lives.",
    "student_submission": "To enhance pedestrian safety and encourage the use of Foot Over Bridges (FOBs), a comprehensive approach is proposed that combines monitoring, awareness, incentives, and engagement. CCTV cameras will be installed at major pedestrian crossing points to monitor behavior, detect violations such as jaywalking, and issue automated fines or warnings through an AI-based system. These cameras will also provide valuable data to analyze pedestrian movement patterns and improve traffic management. Maintaining cleanliness on FOBs is essential to improve their usability, so regular cleaning schedules will be implemented, and maintenance teams will ensure that FOBs remain well-lit, structurally sound, and free from litter, making them more attractive to pedestrians. Awareness campaigns will be conducted in educational institutions, workplaces, and public spaces to educate pedestrians about the dangers of jaywalking and the benefits of using FOBs. These drives will include interactive sessions, street plays, and digital awareness initiatives. Online campaigns will further reinforce these messages through social media, video content, and influencer collaborations to reach a wider audience. A reward-based system will be introduced where pedestrians earn points for using FOBs instead of crossing roads at unsafe locations, and these points can be redeemed for discounts on public transport, shopping, or food outlets, making safe behavior more appealing. Interactive photo booths will be set up near FOBs, allowing pedestrians to take pictures and share them on social media with customized road safety messages, increasing engagement and promoting a positive culture around using FOBs. By integrating technology, awareness programs, incentives, and infrastructure enhancements, this solution aims to significantly reduce pedestrian accidents and promote safer road-crossing habits."
