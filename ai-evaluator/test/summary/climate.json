    "problem_statement": "Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges, with rising temperatures, unpredictable weather patterns, and environmental degradation threatening ecosystems and human livelihoods. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and pollution has accelerated climate change, leading to natural disasters such as floods, wildfires, and hurricanes. Addressing climate change requires urgent and collective action, including sustainable energy adoption, afforestation, waste management, and policy reforms. The objective is to develop innovative solutions to mitigate climate change effects and promote environmental sustainability. This presents an opportunity for individuals and organizations to contribute towards a greener and more resilient future.",
    "student_submission": "To combat climate change and promote environmental sustainability, a multifaceted approach is proposed that incorporates renewable energy adoption, afforestation, waste management, and community engagement. Transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power will significantly reduce carbon emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. Governments and corporations should invest in clean energy infrastructure, incentivize businesses to adopt green practices, and promote the use of electric vehicles. Large-scale afforestation and reforestation initiatives should be launched to restore ecosystems, increase carbon sequestration, and improve biodiversity. Urban areas can implement green roofing, vertical gardens, and community-led tree plantation drives to enhance greenery. Waste management strategies such as composting, recycling, and banning single-use plastics should be enforced, while industries must be held accountable for reducing emissions and adopting sustainable production methods. Public awareness campaigns through digital media, educational programs, and grassroots movements will be crucial in fostering climate-conscious behavior and encouraging sustainable lifestyle choices. Additionally, international cooperation and policy reforms should ensure stricter environmental regulations, carbon taxes, and conservation efforts to combat deforestation and pollution effectively. By integrating clean energy solutions, reforestation efforts, responsible waste management, and public participation, this comprehensive plan aims to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and create a sustainable future for generations to come."
