    "problem_statement": "All that you need to know about Road Safety Hackathon Did you know that on India's National Highways, pedestrian accidents are increasing at an alarming rate? In just one year, pedestrian fatalities have risen from 9,462 to 10,160, which means an average of one pedestrian dies every hour. Despite the presence of Foot Over Bridges (FOBs), many pedestrians continue to cross the roads at grade level, highlighting a critical safety issue. This highlights the urgency of addressing pedestrian and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) safety, especially the underutilization of Foot Over Bridges (FOBs) and the need for safer crossings and infrastructure improvements. In light of these concerning statistics, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Highway Operators Association - India (HOAI) are coming together to host a joint hackathon aimed at finding innovative solutions to improve pedestrian safety on national highways. This is an exciting opportunity for you to be part of a project that could make a real impact on road safety and help save lives.",

    "submission": "Enhancing Pedestrian Safety Through Inclusive, Engaging, and AI-driven FOB Solutions. Current FOB designs and solutions in India face several challenges, leading to underutilization and pedestrian fatalities. Lack of inclusivity: Many FOBs are not equipped with ramps, elevators, or wide staircases, making them inaccessible for elderly, disabled, and pregnant individuals. Location of FOB: Placement may be far from natural pedestrian crossings, discouraging usage. Poor visibility and accessibility: FOBs often lack bright colours or clear signage within a 500-meter range to alert pedestrians to their presence. This comprehensive approach tackles challenges related to accessibility, user awareness, convenience, and infrastructure design. Key Features: 1. Inclusive FOB Designs: Equip FOBs with ramps, stairs, and elevators to accommodate diverse users & space for people to sit and rest. Ensure mixed-mode FOBs have dedicated sections (marked in distinct colours) for different user types with barriers to prevent misuse. 2. Visual and Psychological Engagement: Bright-coloured FOBs to improve visibility and attract attention. Monthly graffiti and posters to maintain public interest and display promotional/social awareness messages. Install photo/video displays visible from roads highlighting the dangers of jaywalking, puzzles and games on floor to play. Proposed Solution Challenges: 1. Technical Constraints: Implementing AI/ML systems may require extensive data collection and processing; partnering with tech companies can mitigate this. 2. User Acceptance: Initial resistance can be overcome by sustained campaigns and influencer involvement. 3. Financial Feasibility: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds and government grants can help finance the project. 4. Maintenance: Establish dedicated teams for periodic inspections and upkeep. Impact: Short-term: Increased awareness of pedestrian safety and proper usage of FOBs. Reduction in road fatalities due to better infrastructure and engagement. Long-term: Cultural shift towards safer road-crossing habits. Data-driven decision-making for effective FOB placement and maintenance. National recognition as a successful road safety model adaptable to other countries."
