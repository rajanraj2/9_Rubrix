    "problem_statement": "All that you need to know about Road Safety Hackathon Did you know that on India's National Highways, pedestrian accidents are increasing at an alarming rate? In just one year, pedestrian fatalities have risen from 9,462 to 10,160, which means an average of one pedestrian dies every hour. Despite the presence of Foot Over Bridges (FOBs), many pedestrians continue to cross the roads at grade level, highlighting a critical safety issue. This highlights the urgency of addressing pedestrian and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) safety, especially the underutilization of Foot Over Bridges (FOBs) and the need for safer crossings and infrastructure improvements. In light of these concerning statistics, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Highway Operators Association - India (HOAI) are coming together to host a joint hackathon aimed at finding innovative solutions to improve pedestrian safety on national highways. This is an exciting opportunity for you to be part of a project that could make a real impact on road safety and help save lives.",
