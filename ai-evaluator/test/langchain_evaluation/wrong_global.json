    "problem_statement": "All that you need to know about the Global Warming Challenge. Did you know that global temperatures have risen by over 1.2Â°C since pre-industrial times, leading to extreme weather patterns, rising sea levels, and biodiversity loss? Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial activities and deforestation are the primary contributors, with global CO2 levels reaching a record 419 ppm in 2023. Despite global efforts to curb emissions, the lack of scalable and cost-effective carbon capture solutions remains a major hurdle. This highlights the urgency of developing innovative and practical strategies to mitigate climate change and reduce our carbon footprint. To address this crisis, leading environmental organizations are hosting a global innovation challenge to find sustainable solutions for reducing CO2 emissions and promoting carbon neutrality. This is your chance to contribute to a greener future and drive real change in the fight against global warming.",
